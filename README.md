netbeans plugin to support processing.org API

http://processing.org is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

As it is based on Java, it is also possible to code in this language and use processing as an external library. 

What is the advantage of doing so? Sometimes, java developers just love playing with processing API which is simple, well designed and efficient in the audio/visual digital art domain. While sketches (name of processing.org programs) are very nice to prototype ideas, some will prefer to benefit from Java language, its Object Oriented approach, when the project starts to grow. 

Netbeans (http://netbeans.org) is a great Open Source IDE when it comes to produce java code, and this plugin aims at making easier the way to work with porcessing within you java code, allowing to: 
- create a java processing project from a provided template including processing libs
- add processing.org contributions libraries thanks to an included downloader/installer

Currently, the netbeans 8 version is supported.
