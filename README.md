netbeans plugin to support processing.org API

http://processing.org is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

As it is based on Java, it is also possible use processing as an external library of a full Java project. 

What is the advantage of doing so? Sometimes, java developers just love playing with processing API which is simple, well designed and efficient in the audio/visual digital art domain, but just prefer to benefit from Java language and its Object Oriented approach when the project sketches (name of processing.org programs) start to grow. 

Netbeans (http://netbeans.org) is a great Open Source IDE, and this plugin aims at making easier the way to work with processing within your java code, allowing to: 
- create a ready-to-run java processing project from a provided project template including processing libs and main class
- add processing.org contributions libraries thanks to an included downloader/installer
- benefit from code completion, debugger, profiler and other usual tools from the netbeans IDE

Currently, the netbeans 8 version is supported

**_(notice the plugin is not officially released yet on the netbeans plugins page, coming soon)_**
